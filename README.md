Google is marking PAC-MAN's 45th anniversary with a Halloween-themed Doodle that brings the arcade legend back to life using Phaser 3. Built in collaboration with Bandai Namco Entertainment, the game offers eight levels of ghost-chomping action, including four specially crafted haunted-house mazes.

Players navigate PAC-MAN through spooky environments while collecting Dots and avoiding the familiar quartet of ghosts: Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde. Each haunted house features distinctive layouts that mirror the personality traits of its ghostly resident. Power Pellets let you turn the chase around and hunt down the ghosts for bonus points.

Developed with Phaser 3, the Doodle demonstrates the framework's strength in delivering classic arcade experiences with fluid performance and tight controls. The game is available to play directly from Google's homepage for a limited time.
